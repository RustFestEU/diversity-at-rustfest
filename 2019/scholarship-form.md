### What’s the expected cost of your accommodations? (EUR)
[______________________] text input

If you will be booking your own accommodations, tell us your expected costs (in Euros), so we could offer to reimburse you (in full, or part of the cost) after the conference. Scholarship recepients will receive an upper reimbursement limit with their acceptance confirmation. Accommodation reimbursements will be submitted based on the receipt of the travel booking/hotel folio after the conference as part of other reimbursements.


### Travel preferences
- [ ] I will be attending the first day of the conference (Saturday)
- [ ] I will be attending the second day of the conference (Sunday)
- [ ] I will be attending either or both Impl Days (Monday / Tuesday after the conference)
- [ ] I am traveling from a distant time zone and would prefer to arrive one day earlier to recover (incl. an extra hotel night, if applicable)
- [ ] I am planning to spend extra days (personal time) in Barcelona before/after the conference

Tell us more about your plans/availability so we could best support your attendance.

For people whose travel would involve an especially taxing time-zone shift (6+ hours) we offer the possibility to arrive a day earlier to recuperate, including covering the extra hotel night (note, this offer is presented on a case-by-case basis and pending budget availability).

Please note, it’s perfectly fine if you planned to spend additional time before/after the conference days in Barcelona, but RustFest won’t be able to support the extra nights of accommodation for personal time (beyond the above stated exception).
